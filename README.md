# BlancaeNet

## Introduction

This repository contains the computational application for recognizing Atlapetes blancae through audio and video analysis. The application includes an executable file that performs the recognition process.

## Contents

The repository includes the following:

- **Executable:** The executable file for the computational application (compatible with Windows). Please note that you need to download and install MATLAB Runtime(R2023a) for the executable to work. You can download MATLAB Runtime from the following link: [MATLAB Runtime](https://www.mathworks.com/products/compiler/mcr/index.html).
- **Source Code:** The source code used to generate the executable and train the neural network.
- **Dataset:** The dataset used for training and evaluation. You can download the dataset from the following link: [Segments of video frmaes](https://udeaeduco-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/r/personal/julian_santamaria_udea_edu_co/Documents/BlancaeNet_Interfaz_Matlab/Base%20de%20datos/Frames%20Videos%20segmentados?csf=1&web=1&e=c2ynab), [Audio](http://i2d.humboldt.org.co/ceiba/resource.do?r=bancosonidos).

## Usage

To use the computational application, follow these steps:

1. Download the entire repository to your local machine.
2. Make sure you have downloaded and installed MATLAB Runtime(R2023a) from the provided link.
3. Ensure that the files `CNN_and_Data_Atlapetes.mat`,`Resnet18_AtlapetesBlancae.mat` and `krgb.mat` have been downloaded correctly (check the file size. The file sizes should be different from 1KB). If they have not been downloaded correctly, download them individually and place them in the corresponding folder.
4. Run the executable or execute the provided code to initiate the recognition process.
